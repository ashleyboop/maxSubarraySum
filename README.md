# maxSubarraySum
the max sum of the subarrays


Tuesday 10/25/2016

Problem: 
Generate 1000 random integer and populate the array.
Write a script that tells you the starting and ending index at which you find the highest sum of integers within the array. 
Once you have it send it to me. If you want you can use https://jsfiddle.net/ and send me the link



NOTE: Testing it with small numbers, once it works i'll change the size, SIZE to 1000.
Also, wrote code in C++ not javascript
